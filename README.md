This is just a quick and dirty app I wrote to launch Google Lens during the few hours it was accessible.

All it does is accept an Intent carrying an image and then send a new Intent to a specific activity in the Google Photos app. It's only a few lines of code that took about 10 mintues to write and test. It doesn't cover many of the possible issues that could crop up. Further, it's only useful for launching Google Lens (which isn't currently functional)
